        not sure this is the best place to track todos, but i'll just dump stuff
        here for now and figure that out later...

        the live site is experiencing pretty bad <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">fout</a>
        all of a sudden. which is weird, because i didn't fundamentally change
        anything afaik. or maybe not?

        i'm not sure what the right thing to do for css is. when i'm
        "engineering", i like to use
        <a
        href="https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md">suit</a>
        naming conventions. but this is not that, and it's kinda annoying to
        drop an h2 and p tags next to one another and not have the spacing "just
        work". but then, when you want to use a class you run into the annoying
        <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity">specificity</a>
        clashes that suit solves...
      </p>

      <p>
        thinking that maybe the best solution is to use component classes for
        scoping descendent styles and to just be careful. as long as components
        that might change (aren't generated) are in fragments, it's probably
        okay.

        the <em>only</em> thing that really bothers me about writing directly
        into html is trying to figure out how to format <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
        tags. they are huge, they mess up all the line breaks. maybe a link
        index that <a href="https://github.com/tycobbb/www">the build tool</a>
        can use to preprocess links? i can't anything much shorter...
