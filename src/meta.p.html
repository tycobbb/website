        not sure this is the best place to track todos, but i'll just dump stuff here for now and
        figure that out later...

        the live site is experiencing pretty bad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">fout</a>
        all of a sudden. which is weird, because i didn't fundamentally change anything afaik.

        i'm not sure what the right thing to do for css is. when i'm "engineering", i like to use
        <a href="https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md">suit</a>
        naming conventions. but this is not that, and it's kinda annoying to drop an h2 and p tags
        next to one another and not have the spacing "just work". but then when you want to use a
        class you run into the annoying <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity">specificity</a>
        clashes that suit solves...
