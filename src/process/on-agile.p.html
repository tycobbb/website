        agile (little a, always little a) is't bad, it shouldn't be a dirty
        word. it's an elastic collection of values, principles, and practices
        for people to freely pick and choose from as they see fit, to help us
        find ways of working well together.
      </p>

      <p>
        why does it have a bad reputation? the freely picking and choosing
        practices bit often goes out the window. any process, and agile is no
        exception, can be co-opted by people with power who want to use it as a
        means of centralizing authority and control. such people can simply
        declare "these are the agile practices", officialize it with a name like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>,
        professionalize it with a
        <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-i-certification">
          certification authority</a>, enclose on the process in some limited
        domain (like a company), and use it to do violence against workers.
      </p>

        i think where agile goes wrong is not agile, but poisoned culture and
        poisoned ideas about workplace hierarchy. there is something to be said
        for the fact that agile doesn't protect against the above enclosure, but
        can it? i think that's a different problem domain, addressed by building
        personal, trusting relationships and structuring organizations legally
        to protect one another (like say, co-ops).

        such to say, let's not lose sight of our process'
        <a href="/process/on-disintegration">fungibility</a>.
        it serves Us not the other way around. but we probably do need
