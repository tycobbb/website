        i feel like the idea of disintegrating process, process that melts away
        as its no longer needed, is extremely desirable, core to agile even. the
        thing i'd written about as missing from most
        <a href="/process/on-agile">corporate repackagings</a> of the idea.

        iirc, in the intro to the "practices" chapter of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">kent beck's</a>
        great-but-terribly-titled-book
        <a

        programming explained: embrace change</a>
        (just the intro, but surely you know where to find it), he mentions that
        none of the what follows is necessary for a well-functioning team. what
        follows is pages-upon-pages of specific work practices: meetings, tools,
        structure, habits, &c. he suggests that a team that's in sync on their
        values & principles (in this book: trust, honesty, open communication,
        &c) doesn't <em>need</em> any of that structure to work well together.
        the values are so deeply felt that the team expresses them organically
        through their every action. the practices simply are, they're not extra,
        they don't need reminding.

        but getting there is extremely hard, so we try the practices on until we
        begin to understand their purpose on a deeper level, on that
        values-and-principles-level, through experimentation. processfeel. but
        they were always meant to disintegrate, we're trying to destroy them,
        slowly. we don't want them, but we know we might need them for now.

      <p>
        then again, there may be some structure that's
        <a href="/process/on-feedback">worth hanging onto</a>.
