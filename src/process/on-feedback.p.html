        feedback is probably the hardest and most important thing, in general.
        it's definitely the hardest dimension of a <a
        href="/process/on-process">process</a>. it's where we feel the
        vulnerability, care, compassion, &c required to
        <a href="/process/on-working-well">work well together</a> most intensely.
        it requires that we <strong>work</strong> to provide each other a
        tremendous amount of
        <a href="/process/safety">psychological safety</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        it's also something that's easy to let fall by the wayside. to fail to
        incorporate into our practices, for everything to be falling apart
        around us without our realizing, to not see the collapse coming before
        it's too late.

      <p>
        we're <a href="/process/on-working-well">working so well together</a>
        that feedback flows freely back and forth, that the toxic effects of our
        problems never manifest, because we are un/conciously solving them
        before they reach critical mass. i think this situation is rare. if it
        ever happens, i imagine it only happens once the structure that
        facilitated this state
        <a href="/process/on-disintegration">disintegrated</a>. and even if we get there,
        i think we can easily end up in a space where feedback that needs to
        happen isn't, all without realizing it. it's one of those places where i
        think there should be some undissolving structure (it's why i am adamant
        about
        <a href="/process/retros">weekly retros</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        i can think of that i think are helpful to consider when thinking about
        feedback [process].

      <p>
        structure helps us to build up psychological safety around giving
        feedback by making it regular, to some degree formal. that we've all
        <a href="/process/on-agile">voluntarily accepted</a> the structure
        provides some measure of comfort when we need to surface painful
        feelings or bring up hard conversations. unstructured, unsolicited
        feedback poses a high social & emotional hurdle to overcome. we need
        some way to build up speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        for example, as someone who's generally quiet, i know i struggle to
        speak up when the feedback is structured “town hall” style. the town
        hall format may be too <strong>little</strong> structure for me. a
        <a href="/process/retros">retro</a> provides the time and space that i
        need to express my thoughts without being directly perceived, to see and
        feel my teammate's thoughts.
      </p>

      <h4 id="un-directed">un / directed</h4>

      <p>
        i've been trying to make sense of why "seeking input" feels different
        different in kind to my own conception of “feedback”. where i've landed,
        at the moment anyways, is that input is “directed”: it's seeking a
        solution to a problem. on the other hand, i tend to think of “feedback”
        as undirected: providing space for us to voice feelings & concerns
        without being constrained by particular problems, or even the need to
        have solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        undirected feedback allows people to be heard and tends to surface
        surprising problems we didn't even know existed. it risks sometimes
        collapsing into complaining, but that's something that can be addressed
        w/ framing.
      </p>

      <p>
        what's special about <a href="/process/retros">retros</a> to me is that
        they're a structured (bounded, safe) practice that channels both
        undirected feedback, to solicit surprising problems, and directed input,
        to solve those problems.
      </p>

      <h4 id="in-dividual">in / dividual</h4>

      <p>
        is the feedback surfaced to a group, or to a person, one-on-one? i think
        these both have different affordances, surface and address different
        problems, and are both important. a team that's <a
        href="/process/on-working-well">working well</a> needs both. still
        thinking about this one.
