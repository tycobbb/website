        it's pretty rough rn, because i made the (bad? good?) decision to try and
        build a <a href="https://github.com/tycobbb/www">static site generator</a>
        rather than a website.
      <p>

      <p>
        i feel intense <a href="https://html.energy/home.html">html energy</a>. i
        long for web0. i also like templating. i'm making a static site generator
        that respects the web, because i struggled to find one (though, they probably
        exist).
      </p>

      <p>
        for me anyways, web0 is static, handmade, tiny. this site already has a bunch
        of css and js. it has spa-like nav that's implemented in
        <a href="os/os.js" target="_blank">one js file</a>. each element, as far as i'm
        concerned, follows those 3 principles.
