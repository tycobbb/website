        i feel strong <a href="https://html.energy/home.html">html energy</a>.
        i like web0. i don't want to deal w/ so much complexity (just the
        complexity i'm imposing on myself). but i also like templating. i'm
        making a
        <a href="https://github.com/tycobbb/www">static site generator</a> that
        respects a simple, standard web. because i struggled to find one
        (though, they probably exist).
      </p>

      <p>
        for me anyways, web0 is static, handmade, tiny. i'm okay with some fancy
        css and js, this site already has a bunch of it. it has spa-like nav
        that's implemented in
        <a href="/os/os.js" target="_blank">one js file</a>. it still, as far as
        i'm concerned, follows those 3 principles.
