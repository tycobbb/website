        a few nights ago i beat getting over it with bennett foddy after what's
        likely two years of trying.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've put the game down & picked it up & put it down again so often that
        i can't identify the precise time frame anymore. it has loomed there, as
        background element in my life, nagging and gnawing at me, for an
        unknowable duration. according to steam, my total playtime over those
        two years was only 10 hours, according to the game, around 9 and a half.
        that's a small fraction of active time over a two-year period, and i
        think also totally unrepresentative of the presence it has had in my
        life, on me.
      </p>

      <p>
        when i finally saw diogenes floating away, after i'd caromed off the
        last bit of mountain, i began to weep. even as i write this, i can feel
        the emotions of that moment welling up inside me, activating around my
        eyes, tears preparing to flow forth at moment's notice. i wept for
        myself, for the no-longer-bearable release of the joy & stress &
        excitement & frustration & intensity that i internalized & carried &
        processed & compartmentalized in my attempt to get over it.
      </p>

      <p>
        i wept as the credits rolled, as i read bennett's letter, his heartfelt
        overtures to the player (of which i am just one), its expressions of
        thanks to many people i know personally. i wept for him, for him having
        produced this work, for this shared experience, for the network of
        people connected by this game. i imagined him sitting there writing the
        letter, the gratitude he may have felt towards those who supported him
        in its creation, and i felt a reflection of that gratitude, towards him,
        towards that community of support, towards that community reflected
        through getting over it into a play community of common (as in union) &
        rare (as in remote) understanding. an understanding i'd developed of
        myself, for myself, of others, that others developed of themselves, for
        themselves, of me.
      </p>

      <p>
        and i continued to weep after the credits, for nothing at all, for joy,
        for the now amalgamated & indiscernible & unrelenting mass of emotions
        confusing & clouding my every sensory inlet, boiling over through every
        expressive outlet my body made available to my heart & brain. i learned
        later that bennett sung a version of "going down the road feeling bad"
        behind the credits, but i didn't hear it. i believe it was there, that
        it bounced around in my ears, but it never made it past that point.
      </p>

      <p>
        after an hour or so, i calmed down a bit, but ghosts of those feelings
        lingered around the edges of my consciousness. they broke through to the
        forefront regularly over the following hours and more intermittently
        through the following days, nights, today. when they broke through, i'd
        reach out to a friend to talk to them about their experience playing (&
        maybe even beating) getting over it, about mine. i'd scour the internet
        for the reflections from people who were strangers before but to whom
        i'm now deeply-and-permanently bonded.
      </p>

      <p>
        and i couldn't find much, written anyways, about what it felt like for
        others to finish the game. i was reduced to watching (and crying over) a
        five-year-old reaction video of markiplier catching his win. so i write
        this post both to hold my own feelings close and to hold them outwards,
        to share them with anyone who might find themselves in similar state.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've never had a more intense reaction to any artwork, any output, any
        artifact. the closest experience i can think of is, unfortunately, the
        feeling of solving a critical, project-stopping software problem. one
        that my employment relies on, that i'm solely responsible for, for which
        i've exhausted all my ideas & resources, that i'm not sure that i'll
        ever solve, in which, through mind-numbing pressure, giving up becomes a
        possibility, a necessary consideration. the release of stress upon
        finally finding the solution is powerful, but it doesn't feel good. it's
        packaged with a threat of a loss of livelihood that success merely
        averts.
      </p>

      <p>
        getting over it felt kind of like that to me in terms. i didn't reach
        the anvil until a few days ago, a few days at the tail end of multiple
        years. it wasn't the first obstacle i struggled with, but it was the
        first time i wasn't having fun. waves of desolation began to sweep over
        me, i started to consider that i might never finish the game, that i
        might have to give up, that i might be broken over that slab of metal. i
        don't know if what propelled me through the game up to that point was
        hope or determination or stubbornness or resolve or pride or some
        combination thereof, but i felt it flickering out. closing the game
        suddenly became painful. opening it again even more so.
      </p>

      <p>
        i chose to keep opening it, anyways. i wasn't scooting around under a
        threat of loss of income were i to decide to never try again, but i did
        feel like i was under threat of losing something. some part of myself.
        one that i can't quite name, one beyond an admission that i lack some
        skill or physical or mental ability. it felt closer to acknowledging
        that the hope, desire, confidence, appreciation, love, determination,
        commitment, &c that kept me volunteering wasn't enough. that i didn't
        have the right combination or a sensitive enough understanding or enough
        of them to continue.
      </p>

      <p>
        that was terrifying to me, the possibility of a failure that might force
        me admit that part of me wasn't enough. i don't particularly want to
        live in a world where those things are aren't sufficient. i want to live
        in the other world (this one! ;), where they are! i was deeply afraid of
        crumbling, of falling to pieces as this game shattered my worldview &
        self, one already under enough stress from the rest of reality's daily
        trials.
      </p>

      <p>
        as i write this i find myself a little uncomfortable with how much of my
        self-conception that it feels like i risked here, that it's even fragile
        enough to be broken. but what good is that self-conception anyways,
        independent of outcome, i simply come out reconfigured. different.
        whatever i've staked, whatever i enjoyed, whatever i suffered to finish
        or not changes me. simply is.
      </p>

      <p>
        i think maybe that's what formed the intensity my experience: the choice
        to risk some part of myself, to risk quite a big part, to risk it over
        and over again, increasingly & unrelentingly, to risk it and feel the
        something, find the something, that results. whatever that might be, the
        decision to get over it.
      </p>

      <p>
        and knowing that there so many others out there who've done the same,
        who finished, who haven't, who've willingly offered some part of
        themselves, perhaps a similar part, perhaps different parts, to try and
        reach the top, who've gotten over "it", for whatever value of "it" they
        found, is beautiful to me. however little or much as we've each chosen
        to risk, we've shared in the act of risking and come out on the other
        side alright.
      </p>

        happy new year =)
