        i had
        <a href="https://twitter.com/helveticade/status/1564598800425041922">a recent twitter interaction</a>
        about the art to be found around image generators  (if there is such a
        thing!) that made me a bit sad, but also did start this post bubbling
        around.
      </p>

      <h1>ethics?</h1>

      <p>
        to get it out there up front: i think image generators like dall-e and
        all prominent cases of machine learning are ethically bankrupt. they're
        trained on
        <a href="./and-ownership">plundered (nonconsensual, uncredited) data</a>,
        the act of which demands
        <a href="https://matthewpburruss.com/post/the-unethical-story-of-gpt-3-openais-million-dollar-model/">unsustainable amounts of energy</a>,
        they
        <a href="./and-extraction">transfer power/wealth to capital</a>
        through the disempowerment & disinheritance & dissolution of (certain
        domains of) labor.
      </p>

      <p>
        automation under capitalism is extraction. machine learning's draw,
        the reason capital invests in it, is its capacity to capitalize
        previously unreachable domains, not the novelty of its products.
      </p>

      <h1>& a proviso</h1>

      <p>
        a prerequisite for employing automation as a tool in service of the
        people is bounding its use to exclusively revolutionary contexts. there
        is no revolutionary use of dall-e or any similarly
        centrally-owned-and-operated image generator. they enrich capital at
        labor's expense.
      </p>

      <h1>& a possibility</h1>

      <p>
        in the case of image generators: maybe building one that is low-energy,
        sustainably-powered, collectively-owned, &c, and using it to produce
        work that exists outside of and actively seeks to replace its analogue
        within the capitalist economy. or, not building or using one at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        or: i don't know, maybe nothing is enough.
      </p>

      <h1>art</h1>

      <p>
        however, once an image generator like dall-e exists, i don't think this
        means we can't use it to make art. it doesn't mean that it is
        aeshetically barren.
      </p>

      <p>
        i operate with an understanding of <em>art</em> as <em>labor in exclusive
        service of a personal subjectivity</em>. an understanding i found
        earlier this year through hours spent entranced, placing & scaling &
        arranging a countable (but countable with difficulty) number of
        <a href="https://frogfrogforg.itch.io/discone">sphere primitives</a>.
        it's one that i've found a lot of use in since.
      </p>

      <p>
        the words: "personal" here demands person(s) and "subjectivity" suggests
        an invidualized, unhomogenized perspective as the result of a set of
        individual experiences. something unavailable to an entity like a
        corporation, or a tool like an image generator. unavailable, also, to a
        tool like a paintbrush.
      </p>

      <p>
        (there's a lot of good stuff out there on art and aesthetics and i'm
        just going to ignore it (i should read more!))
      </p>

      <h1>less/full</h1>

      <p>
        a few weeks ago, i had a conversation with mut about the
        art/less/full/ness around dall-e-likes.
      </p>

      <p>
        i was in the camp of their artlessness on account of my emotional
        response to their unethics and what i perceived to be a fundamental lack
        of both labor and personal subjectivity in their image production. i was
        too focused on their products, their artifacts, i think.
      </p>

      <p>
        making sense of even the possibility of their artfulness is tricky
        since, per above, their concrete use is necessarily captitalized, is not
        transgressive, and is broadly uninteresting. submitting a query to
        dall-e and viewing its output is an artless experience: it <em>is</em>
        devoid of labor and subjectivity, as far as i'm concerned.
      </p>

      <h1>ness</h1>

      <p>
        the idea that revealed their possible art to me was mapping prompt &
        product to concept & execution, to artwork & artifact, to imagination &
        actualization. i'm a bit disappointed in myself for not having mapped
        this more quickly, as the imagination & execution relation is one my
        jams. still a bit too hard-headed at times.
      </p>

      <p>
        given a sequence of queries, imagining the sequence of imaginary images
        an imaginary image generator produces in response is a rich aesthetic
        domain for the creation of new, previously impossible artworks!
      </p>

      <h1>possibly</h1>

      <p>
        previously impossible because, without dall-e (pain), we wouldn't have
        the culturally-shared understanding of the correspondence between a
        query and an image generator's graphical products. the one that we now
        do, the one that emerged in a matter of day(s). but now that we've
        materialized that understanding, we can dispose of dall-e, unburden our
        eyes of sight, descend into our collective imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        obviosuly, that doesn't mean we couldn't imagine images from text. but
        it does mean we now share a new context for doing so, one we can't
        escape from. that we may as well make ours, to whatever extent that is
        possible, rather than or openai's or google's or whatever else's.
      </p>

      <h1>relatedly</h1>

      <p>
        this sort of art is evocative of some of my favorites (magnifying the
        aformentioned disappointment): a fluxus score, the instructions for a
        sol lewitt wall drawing, a room full of dirt, a poem.
      </p>

      <h1>generally</h1>

      <p>
        i think a useful distinction to hold onto is between artwork & artifact.
        the artifact, in this case, being image. an artifact is not the artwork,
        it's a byproduct. i sense the artwork as the artist(s) personal
        subjectivity, a subjectivty that expresses itself through an artifact(s).
      </p>

      <p>
        there may be, then, artworks to be made even from ai-generated
        artifacts, if only we could overcome ai's other ethical shortcomings.
      </p>

      <h1>an imagination</h1>

      <p>
        is a beautiful place, the site of art experience, an instancing of an
        aesthetics. paintbrushes are not interesting, paintings are not
        interesting. but what the paint does to my body. that is.
