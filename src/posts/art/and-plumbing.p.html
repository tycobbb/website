          <w:frag path="link" name="polmarios">this post</w:frag> by
          <a href="https://polclarissou.com">pol clarissou</a> plays on heavy
          rotation in some games circles i'm involved in. while i personally
          think it hits the mark, it's also polemical, divisive. it provokes at
          least a little hostility about as often as it's linked. i don't think
          there's anything wrong with that, and i shouldn't excuse myself from
          such a reaction. my initial response, before the brainworm found it's
          way in, was hostile, as was that of the [the person who shared it with
          me](https://mut.media), and perhaps the person before them. i think
          this is a normal, first-order reaction to a confrontational text. it
          might even be the correct one, sometimes.

          but this text is important. i wanna do my level best to try and
          describe what i think is correct and true about it and in a way that
          makes those ideas palatable. to acknowledge and reconcile a few
          objections that i've felt and heard at least a few times now.

          (i think, maybe, that it's healthier for us to be upfront about those
          feelings. these sorts of qualifications are sometimes used as a form
          of gatekeeping, to shame people into feeling like they are too
          small-brained to understand a thing if they don't already get it. but
          there's gotta be some way to communicate that walking an evolutionary
          emotional journey with respect to an idea is okay without saying that
          it's also obligatory. this is not that obligatory qualification,
          perhaps this is all wrong.)

          (it is oppressively easy for us to get hung up on semantics, on the
          implications of particular words and let those implications obscure
          our understanding of the broader points in a text (e.g. game, good,
          most, &c). to get bogged down in a cyclical search for counterexamples
          that are too easy to find. to take excessive satisfaction in
          "sharpening our swords" at the expense of our learning. it feels good
          to do this.)
