title: "Inviting Conversation"

Two ideas crystallized for me recently. The first is that I shouldn't try to change anyone's mind who hasn't invited me to do so. That's not to suggest waiting until the other person offers a (now memetic) "change my mind". I think that's unlikely to happen and unlikelier still to be uttered in good faith.

I've comparmentalized and understood this idea in certain contexts, like software consulting, for some time. I've been on two projects in my life that involved on-site, process change work. In both cases we failed to achieve our goals, I suspect (at least in part) because I was selfishly convinced of my ability to affect change simply by demonstrating a "better" way. Or even worse, baldly stating a better way. Not only did this fail, but I failed to learn my lesson both times. It wasn't until reading through [Extreme Programming Explained](https://duck.com/?q=extreme+programming+explained) that finally identifed my error:

> Change always starts at home. The only person you can actually change in yourself. No matter how functional or dysfunctional your organization, you can begin applying [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) for yourself...Dictating practices to a team destroys trust and creates resentment. (Beck, Andres 57)

Last week the compartment walls started to crumble. I tried to convince a friend of something sensitive and without invitation. It failed, obviously, and I think both of us walked away feeling unheard. It has certainly eroded trust and created resentment on my side.

The second crystal is that I'm perfectly capable of both inviting _myself_ into conversations and _expecting_ an invitation in return. And I need to be alert to it. I was not invited to this conversation, but at the time I thought I was. It's reasonably obvious, taking a step back, to identify when somebody is questioning, conversant, and inviting new ideas vs. assertive, argumentative, and not interested in hearing them. It's more difficult in the moment. I didn't feel like my ideas were welcome, which hurt, but I hadn't done the work to make sure they were even asked for.

Furthermore, inviting somebody to conversation expecting reciprocation is selfish. I did not expect to be invited otherwise, but I wanted to try to connect. I invited them to conversation, obstensibly creating a safe space for them to express themselves. But when I realized I was not invited I stopped actively listening, and I made that space into a risky one. It wasn't fair to either of us.

This may be premature, but I'm realizing that one of the things I like about blogging is that it's a context where I can express ideas without feeling compelled to persuade. I'm offering my thoughts and extending an invitation for you to share yours too (gotta put up some contact information).

I think the futility of arguing with strangers on the Internet can, to some degree, be explained using the idea of uninvited conversation. It's more difficult to recognize an invitation from a stranger, it's more difficult to recognize an invitation when we're not face-to-face, and we assume that sharing your thoughts publicly is an invitation. It's often not. But this one is!
