title: "Kinds of Forgiveness"

I like this post [on apologies](https://seths.blog/2019/05/defective-apologies/) by Seth Godin. It's a little unclear if it's about apologies by humans or apologies by organizations or both. When it comes to human-to-human apologies, I don't think it's possible to tell the full story without also telling one about forgiveness.

Seth's post describes a few different things someone might want from an apology and how we might execute one depending on those wants. There are many different kinds and configurations of apologies, but I think there's only one kind of forgiveness. That is to let go.

I think there are a lot of ways to get there, though. Just "letting go" seems difficult or impossible. For me personally, I need to engage with my feelings, and then I probably need to sit with them, find kind words, and express them. Sometimes that's enough. Sometimes I need an apology, too. Sometimes I just need to go on a bike ride and lay in the grass.

I'm consistently surprised by how much letting go of my body and sinking into a few tufts of grass does for my state-of-mind.
