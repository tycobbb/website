The difficulty I've had focusing on any task without constant interruption from my phone or computer has frustrated me often these past few months. Reading was a challenge. Finishing a simple task was an ordeal. When I left my job, a co-worker recommended me [How To Do Nothing (Resisting the Attention Economy)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy/oclc/1085144412&) by [Jenny Odell](http://www.jennyodell.com), and after a [less than a month (!) ](/blog/19/06/still-no-silver-bullet) I've finally finished it.

It's a hard book to summarize, so I just recommend reading it and/or [her talk by the same name](https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb). To take a stab anyways, it's an argument for reclaiming control over your attention by intentionally constructing space for your mind (and body) to wander (and wonder). That's the titular "Nothing". To do so requires an active awareness of and resistance against the Attention Economy, the socio-technological structures that seek to direct us (feeds, filter bubbles, notifications, "productivity") rather than allow us choice. Including the choice to simply accept our attention's natural course. That's the titular "Do". By doing so, individually we rediscover _our_ unique perspective, rather than one prescribed to us, on the world. Collectively, we gain the ability to negotiate that diversity of perspectives to improve that very same world. Doing Nothing, it turns out, is active, curious, and constructive rather than inert.

I loved this book and will probably prostyletize it, to irritation, if we see each other in meatspace. It aligns neatly with some of the things I've been thinking about: the tech reckoning, [the independent web](/blog/19/06/dust-off-the-cobwebs), [utopian-ish collaboration](/blog/19/06/bwow-why-work), [broadly-defined ecology](https://www.worldcat.org/title/sand-county-almanac/oclc/999355608). Socialism.

Her writing has widened my view in many of these domains and helped me realize the importance of others that previously hadn't held my attention. That was a major beat of the book, actually, that the "reality" we know is a projection of our attention (map) onto the world (territory). Jenny leans heavily on one of her hobbies, birdwatching, in the book. Before birdwatching, local birdsong was just noise. It didn't factor into her concious understanding of her neighborhood. After birdwatching, birdsong piqued curiousity that in turn revelead new layers of reality. Not just the birds themselves, but their environments, the creatures (including humans) with whom they cohabitate, a sense of their history, of their habits, and an understanding that each of these things is as significant a feature of the world as ourselves.

Some of us aspire to understand the world as comprised of other human beings whose lives are as important, dense, and meaningful as our own. Fewer of us ascribe that same value to animals. Fewer still ascribe that same value to plants. And so on. The farther removed from "humanity" something is, the more we struggle to value it. Ultimately, we're choosing to draw the line somewhere that's personally convenient (plants are "unconcious"), but perhaps the real answer is that there's no line at all.

I think this idea is a sibling to naturalist and ecologist Aldo Leopold's [Land Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_ethic) (who is quoted a few times in the book). Leopold argued that we would continue to destroy the environment until we developed a socio-cultural understanding that _the land_ was at least as important, complex, and meaningful as humanity. Until we make another crack in the lens of "self". That lens was evolutionarilty convenient when our populations were sparse, but it's ultimately an illusion. There's no me. We're multitudes.

I give this book a solid "purchase a copy or check it out from the library as soon as possible".
