[Challenge](/blog/19/06/challenges/) #5 was given to me by my friend, AJ Misterka (AJ!).

> Find 3 people (one must be a senior citizen) and interview for a quote or short story about their live. Like a "Humans of New York" thing.

_If you've never heard of Humans of New York, you should [check it out](https://www.humansofnewyork.com)._

This one was a doozy. Janice handed me this challege on day one, and the mere thought of it quickly [wound me into a stress-knot](/blog/19/06/challenge-0-failure). I've always struggled with social anxiety, and the thought of approaching strangers unsolicited _and_ creating conversation with them was terrifying.

I think the lens that allows this sort of involute, anxious thought to fester is ultimately a self-centered one, and mine was in desperate need of re-grinding. I'm extremely grateful for this challenge, and for receiving it so early in the process, because it forced me to do just that. To immediately confront those feelings, and my general fear of failure, and discover new perspectives with which to see and understand them.

The challenge itself was rewarding in ways I couldn't have predicted. All the clich√©s about the benefits of meeting new people are true: it exposed me to unfamiliar perspectives, it opened unseen doors, and it focused my own direction and sense of purpose. The act of confronting this challenge has rendered me more open and engaged with people in all areas of my life. I think I've had more (off-the-record) conversations with strangers in the three weeks I've been working on it than I've had in the last year. The sense of connectedness that inpsires has opened my eyes to a different way of living. To life, really. It has sparked joy.

That's not to suggest that I've been able to have every conversation with every stranger that I could have or wanted to. The fear is still there, but it's lessened. And each passing conversation lessens it a little bit more.

But the biggest change that both this challenge and the people I spoke to inspired in me is a newfound, near-instantaneous understanding of the power of neighborhood and local community-building. And a profound sense of how lost on us the importance of these human networks are in the Internet era, or whatever we're calling this age.

It's the perverse irony of our extremely-online world that we're lonelier, more isolated, and less secure in our immediate, physical surroundings. We find safety and community through the web, but we don't know the people who live next door (much less the people who live a block away). It's my personal, unresearched opinion that this has had rippling negative effects on not only our ability to commune with strangers, but both on our humanity and on our representation at all political tiers.

We don't know who lives in our neighborhood, so we're more afraid to walk around outside at night. We're disconnected from our neighborhood's history and from people outside our own socio-economic-ethnic strata, so the life-altering effects of gentrification seem remote and inevitable. We don't participate in our immediate, local political organizations, so movements at the state and national levels are organized through the Internet and are as chaotic and unstable as their medium. I think that for all the amazing ways the Internet _has_ connected us, it has left us divided and alone in the perhaps our most important network. The network of people immediately surrounding us.

However, I don't think it's hopeless. I'm actually extremely optimistic. When I mentioned that this challenge has focused my own direction and sense of purpose, this is the that direction. Participation. By being part of my local community organizations, by working to make my neighborhood stronger, and by connecting with people to build a shared neighborhood identity. And in so doing, hopefully helping to tackle these problems where we have the best chance for effect.

[My friend Chase](19/06/my-friend-chase) always said to me that he thought local politics were the best outlet of our political energy. I wrote it off at the time, but I think, now, that he was dead on.
