[A post](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse) about the [personal web](/blog/19/06/a-blogs-purpose/) was the genesis for this blog. That version of the web, the [indie web](https://indieweb.org), is not new and it hasn't gone anywhere. It's the web before "platforms". It's the web of independently-owned websites. It's the web where each person gets to define the shape and sheen of their presence on their own. It's been de-emphasized by web centralization and the push away from individual ownership and towards corporate ownership, but I don't think it will ever die. It's baked into the guts of the web itself, technically and spiritually.

Reading yesterday's Verge article on the [working conditions for Facebook's content moderators](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) (warning: horrors inside) has reinforced my belief that an individually-owned web is the antidote to what ails its centralized cousin. And that an antidote is _necessary_. For some, it may be a matter of life and death. Whereas Facebook, Google, Twitter, et al are incapable of moderating their platforms and collectively demonstrate that they lack the ethical foundation to do so humanely, an independent web is self-policing. The content we create and choose link to is curated and intentional. It's not presented algorithmically.

Creators and visitors to independent sites are only as vulnerable to psychological abuse each individual allows. The centralized web offers a token representation of "the freedom to choose" what and whose content we see while eroding it with ads, "personalization", and filter bubbles at every opportunity. In the interest of profitability, platforms push the working conditions of their employees to the brink of acceptability (the acceptability floor is obviously much lower for contract labor). They apply that same calculus to the web and to us. "Just enough" freedom. The indpendent web, on the other hand, is a self-assembling, continually evolving reputation network. Its participants, not its administrators, manipulate the boundaries. I think that defining our rights around ownership, in particular digital ownership, is going to be the defining problem of the web's next era.

The personal web is less convenient than the centralized one, and inertia is not on its side. I've had a number of conversations about it recently with varying degrees of success. One thing that I've observed is that many people are reluctant to _share_ their thoughts or feelings. I know I've felt that too. I've felt like I've lacked an individual voice, a well of creativity run dry. This blog, and the personal web, has been invaluable in helping me dissolve those self-destructive ideas. On the other hand, I've also had a number of sympathetic, encouraging conversations, and just tonight someone introduced me to [Solid Pods](https://solid.inrupt.com/). There's still hope.

I want to help change this conversation. I want to help define ownership. It's time to dust off the cobwebs. I want the personal web to be accessible to and safe for everyone. I think I've been building towards this for a few years, but I now know I want to make a go of it.
