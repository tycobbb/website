Chase possessed a profound, _personal_ empathy and magnanimity, and he shared it readily with anyone and everyone he met. He had a relentless wit and an uncanny ability to make you feel heard and important in even the most minor conversation. I don't think he was always light-of-heart, but that never stopped him cracking from wise. He never made a joke at someone else's expense.

When he passed, I don't think it's happenstance that so many people considered him their best friend. He was a best friend to total strangers. He occupied himself on weekends by wandering out into the neighborhood, striking up conversations with whomever was nearby, and listening to their stories. He lived a generative, giving life.

I think "empathy" as an idea has become somewhat overloaded. It's regularly used to describe how we might understand and relate to the plight of groups of people at a distance, or even more abstractly to describe how a design should orient itself with respect to its users. No doubt these are important kinds of empathy, but for me, I think it is most potent when personal and proximal. This is how Chase expressed his empathy, and he cast it as a wide net. He connected with people generously, and he connected them to each other gracefully. His was the sort of empathy that unites a network of people and erases their divisions. I think his disposition should not be as rare as it is.

In life, he taught me a lot about how to be a compassionate, kind person and how to be a good friend. He's teaching me now an important lesson about the value of memory and how we necessarily carry our sadness with us, but can become stronger through it (I could have also learned that lesson from Inside Out). I still have a lot to learn from my memory of him and the example he set. He's been on my mind recently, and I've been trying to channel his energy in pursuit of Challenge #1. I will always miss Chase. I want to be the kind of person he would've proud to call a friend.
