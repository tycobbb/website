[Challenge](/blog/19/06/challenges/) #3 was given to me by my friend, Kim Kocek (thanks Kim!):

> Use any medium to create a piece of art in the likeness of Mumsey.

Mumsey is a dog. An adorable Boston Terrier. The first time we met as at a party at Kim's apartment. Kim opened the front door to reveal her now-husband Wes playing with Mumsey, who was dangling from a tug-of-war toy three feet in the air. Mumsey did not let go, ever. She is a fierce pup. As soon you sit down, she's also an cuddly lap dog.

The three of them now live out on a farm in Michigan, and I've never seen Mumsey so happy as when she's running around the property. If I were to characterize Mumsey in a word, it would be "motion". She's _always_ moving; she may be part shark. Initally, I wanted to try to create an animation capturing our first meeting, but I don't have a strong enough grasp on dog anatomy (or animation) to make that happen (yet).

But I wanted to try and capture the spirit of her movement anyways, and here are the results:

Thank you Kim!
