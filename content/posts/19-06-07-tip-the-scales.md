I've long cherished skepticism. I think it's a skill worth nurturing. However, as I've gotten older, began working in offices, met new people, and started new relationships, I've noticed a lot of situations where it hurt someone's feelings or drove a wedge into a conversation. Usually after doing one of those things.

For the better part of this decade, I was wracked with cognitive dissonance. I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, and how could skepticism, cornerstone of the scientific method, be responsible for such a thing? Why couldn't everyone just be _dispassionate_? How can they say that _I'm_ close-minded, I distribute my doubt with an even hand! It took longer than I'd like to admit to find peace with these questions. And during that time I mostly kept my thoughts to myself. Skepticism was the lens I viewed the world through, but I didn't want to cause anyone pain.

I think that skepticism, on its own, is a destructive force. It's not a virtue, it's a tool to break ideas down. It needs to be balanced with constructive tools, like curiosity and creativity, in order to not indiscriminately lay waste to our ideas. Skepticism did close my mind; it closed my mind to everything equally.

However, skepticism provides extremely valuable signal. It's a tool that helps me notice when things might be wrong, but if I pause there I'm likely to offer an unsolicited "I don't think that's right" or "[Well, actually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining)". I think skepticism's real value is as an _internal_ trigger to be curious. It's an alert that I have questions to ask and ideas to explore wholly and openly. Vocalizing skepticism before curiousity isn't constructive. I think we understand this intuitively when we're on the receiving end.

Treating skepticism this way tips the scales towards construction. Towards a world where we build on each other's ideas, rather then trap ourselves in dismissive death spirals. That's how I've dissolved this dissonance for myself, anyways.
