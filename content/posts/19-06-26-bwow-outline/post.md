title: "Better Ways of Working - Outline"

I spent some time today sketching out an outline for [this series of posts](/blog/19/06/bwow). I'm not sure how to organize them, and I'm also not sure that it's worth fussing over at this point. It's only blog. Instead, I'm going to bias myself towards action and start writing based on what I have (and perhaps come back later to update this post as an outline / index for future posts).

Currently, I envision three broad categories:

- Motivations
- Values & Goals
- Implementation & Practices

Most of my plotting involved enumerating some of the values & goals walking backwards into their attendant motivations. We'll start there, and walk backwards into the rest of the posts.
