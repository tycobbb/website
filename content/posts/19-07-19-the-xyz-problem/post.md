title: "The XYZ Problem"

It's easy to miss the forest for the trees. A rabbit might know its three-mile home range of the woods inside out, but it's unlikely to even grasp the existence of anything beyond. I don't think we're much different, except that our home range, rather than flora and fauna, is the abstract ideas and explanations that we're familiar with. That bring us comfort. We might also understand the existence and importance of ideas outside our own, bute we're apt to forget.

Imagine a messy, unsolved issue caused by X, Y, and Z that occurs frequently. Alice, observing an instance of this problem, and who may be sympathetic to its XYZ-ness, makes the unfortunate, public offering: "ugh, another example of X". Bob, who may be sympathetic to Y and Z but is disposed to dismiss X, responds: "well actually, the issue isn't X, it's Y". Since both Alice and Bob are humans, they invariably draw each other into an interminable debate about whether the problem is caused by X or Y. Even if they were aware of its XYZ-ness on some level or at some point in time, they compartmentalize that understanding for the duration of their debate. They may even end up eroding it more permanently.

I like to call this sort of communication and understanding failure the XYZ problem (I've never said it out loud). I think it's a relative of the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem) in the sense that it involves one or more parties advancing the discussion past the point that it's resolvable. To a point closer to their home range. I think it manifests often when we discuss complex issues with non-obvious causes (uh, most of them), and it is the general shape of disagreements where we're "talking past each other". It's easy to find examples in the comment section of any news article or in any contentious Twitter thread. I'm sure I'm responsible for at least my fair share.

The example that prompted this post was [the ProPublica piece on heirs property](https://features.propublica.org/black-land-loss/heirs-property-rights-why-black-families-lose-land-south/), and specifically this spear thrown by one of the article's commenters: "Why pose this as a racial problem? It's not. It's an ignorance problem". It's easy to write this comment off as ignorant (because it is, it's a [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error), it's [bad apple theory](https://www.worldcat.org/title/field-guide-to-understanding-human-error/oclc/1011219301?referer=br&ht=edition), and so on), but I think it's interesting because of how unadorned an example it is of the XYZ problem. The piece spends most of its length describing the history and mechanics of the racism that produced the heirs property issue. I struggle to imagine any reason to dismiss that racism is even a _component_ of the issue other than the commenter is generally disposed to dismissing systemic racism as a cause (why that may be is not the subject of this post).

This problem appears in more subtle and less disagreeable ways too. I see it often in conversations with friends. I think building up the mental infrastructure to notice and identify an issue's XYZ-ness is a way to dissolve (and end) many pointless arguments, at least theoretically. When we notice the XYZ problem, the natural solution is to dissolve debate: "you're right, Y and X both seem like components". If we're good at it, I think this has the added benefit of broadening us, rendering us more open to others' ways of thinking.

It's unlikely that for any non-trivial issue we'll perceive its complete XYZ-ness. _Maybe_ we notice X and Z, much of the time we probably only notice X. If we posit X and someone suggests Y instead, being able to take a step back and consider "why not both?" functions as both an acknowledgment of our incomplete understanding and a more collaborative way to think through the issue. Something to work on, anyways.
