I plan to start a series of posts about what I image is an ideal work environment (at least for software companies). At the core of this ideal is co-op style _equal_ ownership. I suspect that such a model can triage a lot of the corrosive forces that seem to plague many workplaces: centralized authority, intra-office competition, poor hiring decisions, growth-fixation, and inability to properly value each other's work. I also just think it's fair.

I've been reading How to Do Nothing by Jenny Odell on recommendation from an ex-coworker. It's great. In it she describes the Aquarian push in the 1970s towards rural communes, problems they encountered, and their ultimate collapse. This reminded me that I'm more-or-less ignorant of the history of similar efforts and the how's and why's that led to their eventual success or failure.

In order to make this happen, I need to add tags and/or a "series" field to these posts. I'd also like to solicit opinions from all of you about what problems you think a software company built on a foundation of _equal_ ownership might face. I'll use those problems to frame the posts in this series.
