_This is a post about [my motivations](/blog/19/06/bwow-outline) for desiring equally-owned worker co-operatives._

While attempting to enumerate a list of values for the organization I'd like to start or be a part of, I fell backwards into trying to describe the motivations for creating such an organization in the first place. And then backwards still into the question "why work at all?".

I think "work" is society's means of organizing labor in the pursuit of improving quality-of-life for its participants. This is a simple definition and may have issues (please, point them out!), but I find it to be sufficient. Whenever trying to understand whether a work-related practice or idea is beneficial, I try to refer back to it. I'm going to borrow [Fred Brooks' language](/blog/19/06/still-no-silver-bullet) from [No Silver Bullet](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf). I think if a practice or idea facilitates our ability to organize labor and improves our quality-of-life, it is part of the "essential complexity" of working effectively. It has to do both. If it does not, it is "[incidental complexity](http://wiki.c2.com/?NoSilverBullet)".

Incidental complexities are features of the _specific_ organizations we form to accomplish work, rather than features of work itself. And they're not necessary to perform work effectively. They may have been invented (perhaps unwittingly) at our current organization, or they may be artifacts of past experiences carried on by some member(s) of the organization. They may have made sense, even addressed essential complexity, in the time and context they were created. Before entropy turned them incidental.

I think eliminating incidental complexity in our working model is a goal worth striving for, though perhaps an unachievable one. Human relationships, and the networks of them that we call organizations, are too complex and change too quickly to realistically reach that summit. Even identifying all the sources of incidental complexity seems like a daunting or impossible task. We can, however, start with the low-hanging fruit.

For exmaple, the organizations I've been a part of, even those that self-describe as "flat", have been plagued by (often unspoken) division and classification that has seriously impacted both workers' quality-of-life and our ability to organize our labor. I think it's also plain to see how our natural tendency to relentlessly classify (and to reduce, to simplify) has presented innumerable political and social problems throughout history. It's practices like these, many of which are ideas foundational to the organization's charter, that are probably the strongest candidates for elimination. Practices that fail _both_ tests for essentiality. I suspect equal-ownership can eliminate a lot these incidental divisions while avoiding eliminating what's essential, and that's the case I will continue to make throughout this series of posts.

This is the baseline I'm operating from when thinking about work and organziations, what's yours? The next post will dig into incidental division and classification in greater detail, unless I'm pushed in a different direction.
